# Mental Health Questionnaire 2
 Code for deriving algorithmic phenotypes from the second Mental Health Questionnaire in UK Biobank, conducted in 2023. This code is contained within Davis et al, In Prep.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites

* R (tested with version 4.3.0)
    * *data.table* (tested with version 1.15.4)
    * *tidyverse* (tested with version 2.0.0)
    * *dplyr* (tested with version 1.1.4)
    * *optparse* (tested with version 1.7.5)


With R loaded in the system path:

````

Rscript Overarching.R

````

````
Usage: Overarching.R [options]

Options:
	-h, --help
		Show this help message and exit

	-i INPUT-DATA-FILE-PATH, --input-data-file-path=INPUT-DATA-FILE-PATH
		File path to a file to read as the data to process.


	-o OUTPUT-DATA-FILE-PATH, --output-data-file-path=OUTPUT-DATA-FILE-PATH
		File path to a file to write as the processed data.


	-v VARIABLES, --variables=VARIABLES
		Comma separated string of variable names to export from the processed data.
````


If Overarching.R is run without specifying variables, it will output all derived phenotypes for the second mental health questionnaire, as described in Davis et al.

Input data must contain all fields necessary to generate the variables requested -Â a full list of input and possible output variables is available in Overarching.R.

Individual module scripts are available as .R and as .Rmd in the scripts folder.
