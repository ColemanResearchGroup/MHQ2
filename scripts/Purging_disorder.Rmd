>'29144-0.0' == 1

AND
Outside any periods of low weight or regular overeating/binge eating that you may have told us about, what was the longest amount of time where you engaged in any of the behaviours (made yourself vomit, used laxatives, diuretics or pills), on their own or in combination, at least once a week? = 0 At least three months

>'29145-0.0' == 0

AND
During the time when you were engaging in these behaviours, how dependent was your self-worth on your body shape or weight? = 2 A great deal OR 1 A moderate amount

>'29146-0.0' %in% c(1,2)

Expected total n that has answered the MHQ2 questionnaire 169,697

0 + 1 = 168,234 + 1426 = 169,696
