## Not during AN criteria
From the DSM5: "Does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa"
```{r not during AN criteria}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(BE_not_during_AN =
           case_when(
             # "If you reported a time or times of low weight above, do/did you experience episodes of excessive overeating/binge eating during your time(s) of low weight?"
             
             # "Only at time(s) when I was not at low weight"
            (
             `29134-0.0` == 2 |

             `29134-0.0` == 1 |
              
            # "Not applicable, as did not have low weight"
