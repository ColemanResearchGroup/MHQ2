*ICD-11 criteria*
1) Binge eating at least once a week over a period of at least three months. 
PLUS 
2) Either never weighed much less than other people expected 
OR 
Never had BMI indicating underweight 
OR 
Had periods when underweight, but binge eating never occurred when underweight 
PLUS 
3) At time when regular episodes of overeating, none of the listed ways of controlling weight / shape were used 


*Written algorithm*
Have you had recurrent episodes of excessive overeating or binge eating (EP6a) = 02 Yes, at least once a week 
AND 
What was the longest amount of time where you were overeating/binge eating at least once a week? (EP6b) = 03 At least three months 
 
AND 
NOT Case {Extended anorexia phenotype} 
OR 
BMI at low weight} > 18.55 kg/m2 
OR 
If you reported a time or times of low weight above, do/did you experience episodes of excessive overeating/binge eating during your time(s) of low weight? (EP6c) = 00 No, only at time(s) when I was NOT at low weight 
 
AND 
During your episodes of excessive overeating/binge eating, how often have you felt like you did not have control over your eating (e.g. not being able to stop eating or feeling compelled to eat)? (EP7) = 03 At least once a week for at least three months 
 
AND 
Do/did you feel distressed about your episodes of excessive overeating/binge eating? (EP9) =01 Yes 
 
AND 
During the time(s) when you were regularly overeating/binge eating, have you done any of the following as a way to control your body shape or weight? EP10= None of the above 


## Not during AN criteria
From the ICD11: "The individual may be of normal weight or even low weight (though not sufficiently to meet the diagnostic requirements for Anorexia Nervosa)"
```{r not during AN criteria}
MHQ2 <- MHQ2 %>%
  mutate(not_during_AN =
           case_when(
             # "If you reported a time or times of low weight above, do/did you experience episodes of excessive overeating/binge eating during your time(s) of low weight?"
             
             # "Only at time(s) when I was not at low weight"
            (
             `29134-0.0` == 2 |
               
            # "Both at times of low weight and when not at low weight"   
             `29134-0.0` == 1 |
              
            # "Not applicable, as did not have low weight"
             `29134-0.0` == -4
            ) |
              
            # "Only at time(s) of low weight"
             (
               `29134-0.0` == 0 &
                
            # No lifetime anorexia nervosa  #+++JZ: Overarching functionality - needs to be reviewed!!
               AN == 0 & #from external AN
              `29000-0.16` != 17 #from external SELF_REPORTED  #+++JZ: this especially - changed from == 0 as I think we do not have values for everyone
            # +++ add any other reports of AN
            ) ~ 1
           )
  )
